WorldScene.unity:
This is the main world map scene that includes:
- Main Camera with CameraController component
- Directional Light for general lighting
- Empty GameObject named "TerrainGenerator" with TerrainGenerator.cs script
- Empty GameObject named "CityManager" with CityManager.cs script
- Canvas with CityIconUpdater.cs script (for updating city icon positions)
- Empty GameObject named "SceneTransitionManager" with SceneTransitionManager.cs script (with Don't Destroy On Load)
- EventSystem for UI interactions

CityScene.unity:
This is the city view scene that includes:
- Main Camera with CitySceneController.cs script
- Canvas with CitySceneUI prefab
- Lighting setup for city view

2. Add the listed components to each scene
3. Assign scene names in the SceneTransitionManager script
4. Build the scenes in the Build Settings in the correct order
5. Test the transition between scenes by clicking on city icons

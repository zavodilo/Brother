Prefab Description: City Icon

This is a UI prefab that represents a city on the world map. It should be set up as follows:

GameObject: CityIcon
├── RectTransform (anchored to upper left, position updated via script)
├── CanvasRenderer
├── Image (for the city icon graphic)
│   ├── Sprite: Circle or custom city icon
│   └── Color: Blue or custom color
├── TextMeshProUGUI (for city name)
│   ├── Text: City name
│   └── Font size: 14
└── CityIconHandler (script component)
    ├── This handles click events and communicates with CityManager

The CityIconHandler script should be attached to make the icon clickable.
The position of the icon is updated dynamically by the CityIconUpdater script to match the world position of the city.
